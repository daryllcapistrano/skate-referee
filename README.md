# The Game of S.K.A.T.E.

This app serves as a score tracker between two skaters using React hooks to extract stateful logic from components. I will continue to implement more features but I am currently satisfied with the functionality. I build this simple application to learn about React Hooks and incorporate something I am passionate about.

The game of **S.K.A.T.E.** is based on the old basketball game **H.O.R.S.E.** and was first played in the 70’s by vert skateboarding legends Neil Blender, and John Lucero. Later it was adopted to street skating and made famous by the worldwide eS Game of SKATE tournament and The Berrics’ game of skate called Battle at the Berrics.
