# SKATE REFEREE

Keep track of your score as you focus on beating your opponent in a game of S.K.A.T.E.

Features a Random Trick Generator so you will never get stuck thinking about what to try.

## The Game of S.K.A.T.E.

Similar to the old basketball game **H.O.R.S.E.** where players take turns shooting at the hoop from different locations,
skaters take turns attempting to set different tricks for their opponents to try. It was first played in the 1970s by vert skaters [Lance Mountain](https://youtu.be/opXeDOa59tA), [Neil Blender](https://youtu.be/W0lQovAvwkI) and [John Lucero](https://youtu.be/4JOOG5xW73g), and was then adopted by street skaters in the 1980s.

### The Rules

1. Skater One attempts to set a trick by landing a trick of their choice.

- If the trick is _not_ landed, Skater Two attempts to set a trick.
- If the trick is landed, Skater Two must try to land the trick that was set.
- Move onto the next round after the defending skater has attempted the trick.

2. Failing to land the set trick in each round will result in adding a letter to that skaters' score.

- Beginning with 'S' until the skater has missed five tricks, spelling SKATE, and they are out of the game.

3. No trick may be set more than once in the same game.
4. Skaters defending on their last letter, 'T', may recieve two attempts at the trick.

## Future Updates

- [ ] option to add more than two skaters per game
- [ ] SOUNDS! (...but not annoying)
